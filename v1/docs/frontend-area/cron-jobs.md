**Cron** is one of the most useful utility that you can find in any Unix-like operating system.  <br />
It is used to schedule commands at a specific time. These scheduled commands or tasks are known as **Cron Jobs**. 

## Adding a Cron Job

### Via CloudWromo

To add a **Cron Job** click on the button **Add Cron Job** top right.

Select a **Template** that prefills the fields **Minute**, **Hour**, **Day**, **Month**, and **Weekday**.

Enter the **Command** and select the user as which the cron job will be executed.

:::warning Permissions
Running the **Cron Job** as the right user is very important. Running as the right user will prevent permission issues e.g., 
if your script is reading and writing files.

### Via Command Line

The standard linux way to configure **Cron Jobs** on the command line can be used as well.

1) Login via [SSH](users#ssh-login) with the user who should run the **Cron Job** e.g. **john-ssh**.

2) Enter the following command to edit **Cron Jobs**:

```bash
crontab -e
```

3) Enter your **Cron Job**.

On the following [site](https://tecadmin.net/crontab-in-linux-with-20-examples-of-cron-schedule/), you find some useful 
examples of how to configure them.
