**CloudWromo** doesn't provide **E-Mail** because of **performance**. We want to keep it **clean** and **lightweight**.

**E-Mail** is very **complex** and shouldn't be handled by the server that runs your **PHP Apps**.

There are many companies that offer professional **E-Mail** services for less than **$ 1 / user** per **month**.
